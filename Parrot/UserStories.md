## Parrot Project

### What is Parrot?

Parrot aims to enable safe internet browsing for kids, allowing parents, tutors to limit the sites kids can access.

#### Why Parrot?

Because I like parrots. I like hamburgers too, but parrot seems to be a better name.


### Parental Control

Parental control software can filter certain types of content, for example adult sites. Sites providing adult content usually include metadata in pages, so parental control software can filter these sites. In addition some parental control tools also provide site black lists, so you can block these sites.

Unfortunately, there are limitations to the current parental control applications:

- **Assumes providers add metadata classifying their sites**: If a site offers adult content, but fails to add the metadata, there is a risk the site will pass the filters. You can create a blog without any text, only images. If these images are for adults, kids may see them.
- **Limited portability**: If you configure your internet connection at home to filter some sites, you cannot just carry this configuration to a hotel, an airport or cafe.
- **Enabling/disabling sites is time-consuming**: Some tools allow you to configure which sites are safe, but to create and maintain an update list is not easy.



### Parrot Objectives

- **Allow site white list sharing**: Allow parents, tutors, teachers, anyone who cares about internet access to create and share lists of safe sites.
- **Block sites which are not in the white list**: kids will not be able to access sites which are not in the white list.
- **Portability**: allow parents to enable these controls wherever they are.
