## Example Spring Maven Project

### Project Objective

Laboratory to test and document the process of setting up and run a Spring boot application running at Heroku.

### Components

Component | Detail | Comments
------ |------ | ----------------------------------
Java | Java 1.7 | In the server will use openJDK 1.7
Eclipse | Eclipse Luna 4.4.0 |
Eclipse | m2e plugin | Maven to Eclipse, adds Maven support
Hosting | Heroku | Because we will provide Heroku the functionality to monitor
Build tool | Maven | Needed for Heroku
Servlet container | Jetty | Needed for Heroku


### How to create a clean project

The idea here was to create a Spring project as close as possible to the Spring standard, enven though the final objective was to deploy at Heroku. I favoured instructions from Spring, if you check the Maven pom, there is no relation to the one from Heroku. The idea is to have a project you can deploy in environments other than Heroku, without PaaS dependencies.

**General steps from a project from scratch**

- Add m2e plugin to your Eclipse
- In Eclipse, Project > New > Maven Project
- In the New Maven project screen, check "Create a simple project (skip archetype selection)".
- Fill the following page with Group Id, Artifact Id, etc. Packaging is jar.
- Click Finish. This will create an empty Maven project.
- Update the Maven pom.xml having as a reference the Maven pom from this project, and you will be good!



### Heroku

#### Settings

These are the Heroku specific settings

Setting | Parameter | File
------ |------ | ---------
Java version | java.runtime.version=1.7 | project root/system.properties
Heruku Procfile | web: java -Dserver.port=$PORT $JAVA_OPTS -jar target/<generated jar package>.jar | project root/Procfile


#### Running at Heroku for the very impatient (or lazy)


##### Prerequisites

- You created a Spring boot project in Eclipse.
- You ran at least one Maven build with goal = package.
- You added files system.properties and Procfile with the settings above.
- You have your stuff in a proper git repo, other than heroku.
- Your project passed unit tests, and integration tests which need the application running have name with pattern Abstract*Test.java (so they will be ignored by Maven surefire plugin)


##### Create App

In the command line, use `heroku create <app name>`. Example:

`heroku create exspring`


##### Deploying App

When creating an App, Heroku creates a git repository for it. Basically what you need to do is to push your changes to this repo. In the Heroku Dashboard, select Apps > Your App > Settings. In Info, you will see the git repository Url which is `git@heroku.com:<your app>.git`. In this example, the repo is git@heroku.com:exspring.git.

**Deployment technique 1**

I am using this technique as at this moment each Github repo is hosting multiple Eclipse projects.

- Select a folder in your workstation: select a folder which will host Heroku repos.
- In this folder clone the Heroku repo: in the folder, execute `git clone git@heroku.com:exspring.git`. This will create a folder underneath your current, containing the repo.
- In the first clone, you will be cloning an empty repo. Copy your .gitignore file from your repo to the heroku repo created, so you you not upload garbage to heroku. Use the **SAME** gitignore from your git repository, so it will prevent you uploading trash and the generated stuff to Heroku. Heroku will run the Maven build again, so no need to upload jar/war.
- Copy the contents of your Eclipse project to the repo. Files which are in the root in the Eclipse project need to be in the root in the repo.
- Go to the repo directory in your machine, then add and push content:
```
git add -A
git commit -m 'deployment commit example'
git push origin master
```

- When you do the push, Heroku will build your app, first getting the dependencies, then compiling and running your unit tests. Extract of the output:
```

```


**Deployment technique 2**

In this scenario, your git repository should contain one project only, so you can add heroku as remote repo and do the push.

##### Accessing the App

In the Heroku Dashboard select Apps > Your App > Settings, then go to domains. you will see a domain with name like `<your app>.herokuapp.com`. To test, put in the browser:

http://exspring.herokuapp.com/greeting?name=Canadiens
