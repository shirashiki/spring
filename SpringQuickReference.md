## Spring Quick Reference

#### Notes

This is my personal guide, for the original documentation go to: http://spring.io/docs


### Configuration Annotations

**@Autowired**: use this to wire a bean. This is part of the dependency injection capabilities in Spring.

**@ComponentScan**: used to indicate which package to search.

**@EnableAutoConfiguration**: makes Spring look for the AutoWired annotations.
